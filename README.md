Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

   The Gaming Room is in the process of developing a game, Draw It or Lose It. The goal is to allow users from all over the world to connect to the same game instance, across varying platforms. The game stores many images to be uploaded and displayed to each connected user, which needs to be in sync and quick, as this is time-based.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

   Writing the recommendations to the client was what this document does well. Going over the pros and cons of each different option will allow them to weigh the benefits of each and select what is right for them and their software's needs. The detailed reply on the server side also goes over the benefits of the application being web-based, allowing users to connect across virtually all platforms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Writing about the client's needs helps in understanding what the application needs to be able to do. Having a chart that goes over the pros and cons of different platforms of development or hosting allows you to weigh the options and pick what best benefits the client; by cost and development time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the executive summary that goes into more detail about the client's needs. Knowing and understanding the end goal allows you to design a well-rounded application that does everything the client needs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

   Having an understanding of what my client wants their application to accomplish helps when designing the blueprints for it. Knowing they want users to be able to connect seamlessly to the same game across a vast amount of platforms, leads to making it a web application. Without realizing the client's needs, making the application a piece of downloadable software, you would have to rewrite the program in countless languages so it is compatible with all platforms, whereas a web application just needs to be responsive. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

   I started the design process knowing the limitations my client had, and what they needed the application to achieve. With these in mind, I was able to sculpt the guidelines for the application Draw It or Lose It. I would utilize web-based development more often for projects such as these, making seamless connectivity across multiple platforms a breeze. Designing software before starting development will be a strategy I will continuously use, as developing a program without a documented plan will lead to potential roadblocks, some of that can hinder development substantially.
